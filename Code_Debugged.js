As a systems engineer üßë‚Äçüíª in the Rich Bank üè¶, you know:

- üìã Each account has the ID(positive integer), the owner(non - empty string), and the balance(non - negative number).
- üßê Account holders can view their accounts using their ID (See: `getAccountById`).
- ü•≥ Customers can create a new account with an ID and their name with 0 balance(See: `createAccount`).
- üí∏ Account holders can deposit money to their accounts with their ID if the amount to be deposited is greater than 0, of course!(See: `depositMoney`).
- üí∞ Account holders can withdraw money from their accounts with their ID if the amount to be withdrawn is greater than 0, of course!(See: `withdrawMoney`).
- üõ´ Account holders can transfer their money to another account holder's account using IDs if the amount to be transferred is greater than 0, of course! (See: `transferMoney`).

The starter code is full of bugs.Your task is fixing the bugs using the knowledge above.
